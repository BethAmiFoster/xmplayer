This is a fork of xmplayer by Ced2911 (and now the Libxenon team) with my own customizations.
My customizations, compared to original release, are at the moment (24/07/2012):

Initial:
-Quick fix: Subtitles stays on screen when playing a new video without subs, after exiting a video with subs
-Fixed: "Return to Gui" and starting a video leads to crash 
-Fixed: .avi files not playing after a .mkv, .mov or .mp4 file has been played 
This fix is done via mplayer.conf by adding:
[extension.avi]
demuxer=avi
-Added: "Restart" and "Shutdown" buttons 
-Added: "Subtitle Size" under Settings - Atm you can only change size before starting your first video, after that you need to restart before it takes effect
This is quite simple really, have 3 different fonts sizes from mplayerhq's site. This is temporary until the subscale can be implemented with subfont.ttf
-Vsync is now enabled by default (disable via Gui)

24/07/2012:
-Added: A "smart menu" that saves your last selection and path when exiting a menu or playing a video
