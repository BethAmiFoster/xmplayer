Known Issues
================================================================================
- Cannot seek in files over 2 gigabytes (split the files for now)
- Prolonged pausing causes audio to go out of sync, "fix" this by seeking once in the file
- ASS Subtitle handling can cause freezes and lag. If rand
om crashes in video occurs, set ass=no and change vf=ass to #vf=ass in config (ass is disabled by default)
- Playing .rar can be unstable, sometimes freezing XMPlayer
- If your subs doesn't show all the characters, try a different font by replacing subfont.ttf in folder
- XMPlayer does not always mount usb (uda) even though it loads, reload XMPlayer and try again
- Endless loading screen: Try formatting using Gui Format32, or try placing xenon.elf  on root of xbox's internal hdd. 
Place the folder on the root of a usb (ntfs, fat), and then run xenon.elf from the internal harddrive via Dashlaunch.
- Can crash while using play'n'charge kit
- Audio balance not working
- Pictures and Music are not supported
- No networking!
