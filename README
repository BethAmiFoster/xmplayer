This is a fork of xmplayer by Ced2911 (and now the Libxenon team) with my own customizations.
My customizations, compared to original release, are at the moment (30/07/2012):

Initial:
-Quick fix: Subtitles stays on screen when playing a new video without subs, after exiting a video with subs
-Fixed: "Return to Gui" and starting a video leads to crash 
-Fixed: .avi files not playing after a .mkv, .mov or .mp4 file has been played 
This fix is done via mplayer.conf by adding:
[extension.avi]
demuxer=avi
-Added: "Restart" and "Shutdown" buttons 
-Added: "Subtitle Size" under Settings - Atm you can only change size before starting your first video, after that you need to restart before it takes effect
This is quite simple really, have 3 different fonts sizes from mplayerhq's site. This is temporary until the subscale can be implemented with subfont.ttf
-Vsync is now enabled by default (disable via Gui)

24/07/2012:
-Added: A "smart menu" that saves your last selection and path when exiting a menu or playing a video (using y and then exit!)

26/07/2012:
-Fixed: When entering a new folder "Item number/All item number" will not update until moving down on d-pad

29/07/2012:
-Fixed: When paused, the osd buttons (y, xbox, x) unpauses video, only "a" pauses/unpauses now
This is done by adding pausing_keep to the osd binds in mplayer's input.conf
-Changed: The page down icon now only shows, if there are at least more items than a page (10 items pr page) 

30/07/2012:
-Changed: the subtitle quick fix from initial commit has been updated, it looks more stable now

31/07/2012: 
-Added: Resume-playback function: if you stop a video in the middle of playing, it will save last position and resume from there if desired (more than a minute of video has to be played).

05/08/2012:
-Fixed: Osd_show_progression (x) only shows, if osd-button (y) hasn't been pressed before
-Fixed: Smart Menu now support multiple devices
This means that the browser will be reset between devices
-Changed: Osd-button now switches from 1 to 3, this means it only needs one press to full osd and not 4 presses
-Changed: When pressing the pause-button (a) progression will also show
Bind a in input.conf needs to be pausing_toggle osd_show_progression


TODO:
-Change subtitle paths
-Fix bug: The D-pad is very buggy after playing a video, every 2nd time you go out and in a menu it won't respond, but the A and B buttons work fine
-Add support for more subtitle languages
-Make the mplayer's menu working functions available in the main osd, so it no longer will be needed
