Known Issues
================================================================================
Mounting:
- Endless loading screen: Restart. Not working try formatting using Gui Format32. If this doesn't work place xenon.elf 
on root of internal hdd, and place the "mplayer" folder on the root of a usb (ntfs, fat) then launch

Playing video:
- Can crash while using play'n'charge kit
- Cannot seek in files over 2 gigabytes (split the files for now)
- Playing .rar can be unstable, sometimes freezing XMPlayer
- Prolonged pausing causes audio to go out of sync, "fix" this by seeking once in the file

Subtitles:
- ASS Subtitle handling can cause freezes and lag. If random crashes in video occurs, set ass=no and change 
vf=ass to #vf=ass in config (ass is disabled by default)
- If your subs doesn't show all the characters, try a different font by replacing subfont.ttf in "mplayer" folder
- If you exit a video with subtitle-text on the screen, the text will still be there if you play a video wihout subtitles, you 
can fix by going into a video with subs and exiting when there is no sutitle-text

Not implemented:
- Audio balance is not supported
- Pictures and Music are not supported
- DVD not working
- No networking!

Install
================================================================================
- Copy all files to the root of an usb stick, launch it by xell or latest dashlaunch

Debug
================================================================================
- Do you get a red screen? Does xmplayer freeze or get stuck at endless loading? and nothing helps?
Read DEBUG so we can fix the problem together
