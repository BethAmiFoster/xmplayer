- Fixed:The D-pad being buggy after a video has been played
- Fixed: Some bugs with osd displaying delay as -0 because of it being close to zero

- Changed: Updated libass to 0.10.0
- Changed: Ass/ssa is now subtitle default which means outline, color, scale etc. works -Changed: The audio delay option in osd is more logical, a audio_delay of 100 ms doesn't mean audio is 100 ms before video (mplayer standard), but 100 ms after

- Changed: Updated GUI with button indicators, changed page size from 10 to 15
- Added: "Restart" and "Shutdown" buttons
- Added: A "smart menu" that saves your last selection and path when exiting a menu or playing a video (resets between devices)

- Added: All libmenu's working functions available in the main osd, so libmenu will no longer be needed
- Added: Patch from mplayerdev's mailing list which adds support for playing videos inside multivolume uncompressed rar files
- Added: If a .rar file loads, it now gets the extension of the archived file, so the true extension profile is loaded
- Added: The (back) button goes directly back to homepage
- Added: Sort files. By pressing (x) in the file browser, you can order by Name or Date (day/month/year)
- Added: ASS settings can be accessed from the subtitle osd menu
- Added: Set ass=yes and vf=ass in mplayer config. This means it can be disabled and subfont can be used if desired

Version 0.0.1:
-Intial Release

Known Issues
================================================================================
- Cannot seek in files over 2 gigabytes (split the files for now)
- Prolonged pausing causes audio to go out of sync, "fix" this by seeking once in the file
- ASS Subtitle handling can cause freezes and lag. If rand
om crashes in video occurs, set ass=no and change vf=ass to #vf=ass in config
- Playing .rar can be unstable, sometimes freezing XMPlayer
- If your subs doesn't show all the characters, try a different font by replacing subfont.ttf in folder
- XMPlayer does not always mount usb (uda) even though it loads, reload XMPlayer and try again
- Endless loading screen: Try formatting using Gui Format32, or try placing xenon.elf and symbols.elf on root of xbox's internal hdd. Place the folder on the root of a usb (ntfs, fat), and then run xenon.elf from the internal harddrive via Dashlaunch.
- Can crash while using play'n'charge kit
- Audio balance not working
- Pictures and Music are not supported
- No networking!
