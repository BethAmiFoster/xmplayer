Version 0.0.2:
- Fixed: .avi files not playing after a .mkv, .mov or .mp4 file has been played
- Fixed: When entering a new folder "Item number/All item number" will not update until moving down on d-pad
- Fixed: When paused, the osd buttons (y, xbox, x) unpauses video, only (a) pauses/unpauses now
- Fixed: Osd_show_progression (x) only shows if osd-button (y) hasn't been pressed before
- Fixed: Lb and Rb doesn't seek -600/+600
- Fixed:The D-pad being buggy after a video has been played
- Fixed: Some bugs with osd displaying delay as -0 because of it being close to zero
- Fixed: Removed the 1 pixel-width line artifact in videos
- Changed: Osd-button (y) now switches from directly on/off, this means it only needs 1 press to full osd and not 3 presses
- Changed: When pressing the pause-button (a) progression will also show
- Changed: The page down icon now only shows, if there are at least more items than a page
- Changed: The (b) button doesn't exit to homescreen any more, it goes one level up, until root then goes to homescreen

- Changed: Updated libass to 0.10.0
- Changed: Ass/ssa is now subtitle default which means outline, color, scale etc. works 
- Changed: The audio delay option in osd is more logical, a audio_delay of 100 ms doesn't mean audio is 100 ms before video (mplayer standard), but 100 ms after
- Changed: Replaced mxml with tinyxml, because of loading problems and it seems lighter
- Changed: Updated GUI with button indicators, changed page size from 10 to 15
- Added: "Restart" and "Shutdown" buttons
- Added: A "smart menu" that saves your last selection and path when exiting a menu or playing a video (resets between devices)
- Added: Resume-playback function: if you stop a video in the middle of playing, it will save last position and resume from there if desired (more than a minute of video has to be played)
- Added: All libmenu's working functions available in the main osd, so libmenu will no longer be needed
- Added: Patch from mplayerdev's mailing list which adds support for playing videos inside multivolume uncompressed rar files
- Added: If a .rar file loads, it now gets the extension of the archived file, so the true extension profile is loaded
- Added: The (back) button goes directly back to homepage
- Added: Sort files. By pressing (x) in the file browser, you can order by Name or Date (day/month/year)
- Added: ASS settings can be accessed from the subtitle osd menu
- Added: Set ass=yes and vf=ass in mplayer config. This means it can be disabled and subfont can be used if desired
