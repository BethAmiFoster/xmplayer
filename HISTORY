Initial:
-Quick fix: Subtitles stays on screen when playing a new video without subs, after exiting a video with subs
-Fixed: "Return to Gui" and starting a video leads to crash 
-Fixed: .avi files not playing after a .mkv, .mov or .mp4 file has been played 
This fix is done via mplayer.conf by adding:
[extension.avi]
demuxer=avi
-Added: "Restart" and "Shutdown" buttons 
-Added: "Subtitle Size" under Settings - Atm you can only change size before starting your first video, after that you need to restart before it takes effect
This is quite simple really, have 3 different fonts sizes from mplayerhq's site. This is temporary until the subscale can be implemented with subfont.ttf
-Vsync is now enabled by default (disable via Gui) <--- CHANGED, see 05/08/2012

24/07/2012:
-Added: A "smart menu" that saves your last selection and path when exiting a menu or playing a video (using y and then exit!)

26/07/2012:
-Fixed: When entering a new folder "Item number/All item number" will not update until moving down on d-pad

29/07/2012:
-Fixed: When paused, the osd buttons (y, xbox, x) unpauses video, only "a" pauses/unpauses now
This is done by adding pausing_keep to the osd binds in mplayer's input.conf
-Changed: The page down icon now only shows, if there are at least more items than a page (10 items pr page) 

30/07/2012:
-Changed: the subtitle quick fix from initial commit has been updated, it looks more stable now

31/07/2012: 
-Added: Resume-playback function: if you stop a video in the middle of playing, it will save last position and resume from there if desired (more than a minute of video has to be played).

05/08/2012:
-Fixed: Osd_show_progression (x) only shows if osd-button (y) hasn't been pressed before
-Fixed: Smart Menu now support multiple devices
This means that the browser will be reset between devices
-Fixed: Lb and Rb doesn't seek -600/+600
Also changed the binds of "r" and "l" to "c" and "v" in input.conf (it didn't seem to detect lowercase l and r)
-Changed: Osd-button now switches from 1 to 3, this means it only needs 1 press to full osd and not 3 presses
-Changed: When pressing the pause-button (a) progression will also show
Bind "a" in input.conf needs to be "pausing_toggle osd_show_progression"
-Removed: Font folder and subtitle size, not needed anymore
Without font-folder the subfont.ttf works fine, with font-scale working
-Added: Support for multiple subtitle languages
Supported language depends on subcp, slang and font. See mplayer\config

06/08/2012:
-Fixed:The D-pad being buggy after a video has been played, every 2nd time you go out and in a menu it won't respond, but the A and B buttons work fine

09/08/2012:
-Added: All libmenu's working functions available in the main osd, so libmenu will no longer be needed

10/08/2012:
-Added: When quiting via libmenu or quit-button (b is binded to quit now), it will now save last position
-Added: Patch from mplayerdev's mailing list which adds support for playing videos inside multivolume uncompressed rar files
Haven't been tested intensively. 

13/08/2012:
-Changed: The B-button doesn't exit to homepage any more, it goes one level up, until root then goes to homepage
-Added: The Back-button goes directly back to homepage
-Added: [extension.rar] demuxer=lavf in mplayer.conf <-- see 17/08/2012

17/08/2012:
-Removed: [extension.rar] demuxer=lavf in mplayer.conf
-Changed: [extension.mp4] demuxer=mov to demuxer=lavf in mplayer.conf, lavf handles .mp4 files better than mov
-Changed: have disabled libmenu, now that osd menu has the same functions, can cause instability
-Added: if a .rar file loads, it now gets the extension of the archived file, so the true extension profile is loaded

27/08/2012:
Added: Sort files. By pressing "x" in the file browser, you can order by Name or Date (day/month/year)

28/08/2012:
Changed: The audio delay option in osd is more logical, a audio_delay of 100 ms doesn't mean audio is 100 ms before video (mplayer standard), but 100 ms after

29/08/2012:
-Changed: Updated libass to 0.10.0
-Changed: ass/ssa is now subtitle default which means outline, color etc. works 
-Added: ass settings can be accessed from the subtitle osd menu (ass can be buggy, video freeze etc.)

04/09/2012:
-Changed: replaced mxml with tinyxml, because of loading problems and it seems lighter

05/09/2012:
-Fixed: some bugs with osd displaying delay as -0 because of it being close to zero
-Added: set ass=yes and vf=ass in mplayer config, with vf=ass it looks stable, haven't experienced freezes. This means it can be disabled and subfont can be used if wished

17/09/2012:
-Added: Global, audio, video and subtitles settings in menu (no need to play with mplayer config files anymore)

01/09/2013:
-Fixed: When in OSD-menu when paused, pressing (Y) won't remove OSD-menu: vo_xenon.c didn't detect the change because flip_page wasn't called, so video-out was not updated until 
video was resumed or seeked in
06/09/2013:
-Fixed: Better support for big USB drives (mount code from XeLL v0.993)

07/09/2013:
- Added: Support for .rmvb files: .rmvb now shows as videofile under Videos, set lavf as it's demuxer in mplayer.conf
- Changed: Disabled balance in osd menu, it doesn't work
- Fixed: Audio- and subdelay shows -0 ms: audio and subtitle delay are not always zero, but because they are floats they can come increadibly close so they can show up as -0.
- Fixed: First time you enter osd menu when paused, it removes it again: Even when osd_level = 3 the OSD layer detected the keypress you made for entering the menu, as 
Y is the OSD button it would remove OSD again. Sometimes OSD would show but then, osd_level = 1 (the player) would detect your next keypress
- Fixed: Volume not changing in audio settings when paused: the OSD wouldn't update the change in volume when video was paused. This was because the OSD used mplayer queue command 
that only works when the video is playing, when paused it queues the commands
- Fixed: Mplayer crashes if .rar archive is not supported: mplayer would crash if it was a .rar archive that stream/unrar.c didn't support. By checking the .rar before we make
mplayer play the file, we avoid the crash

10/09/2013:
- Added: New subtitle shader with outline. Increased stability because libass is not needed: added a custom pixel shader to vo_xenon.c, so no need for a power hungry libass. 
Subtitle color is white and outline color is black
- Changed: Libass disabled as default, beware libass makes xmplayer unstable: libass uses a lot of CPU power which can make xmplayer unstable, freeze and crash
- Changed: Subfont from Arial to Dejavu Sans: better looking imo

11/09/2013:
- Fixed: Elf files not loading after a video has been played: fixed in libxenon, by changing fstat() to stat() in elf.c's load from disk
- Fixed: Overload buffer and memory leak leading to random crashes: fixed by lots of cleanup of code, mainly changing char* into std::string in .cpp files

12/09/2013: 
- More code cleanup, adding std::string to libgui functions
