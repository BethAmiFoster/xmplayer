V1:
Quick fix: Subtitles stays on screen when exiting video with subs, via XMPlayer Gui, and playing a new video without subs.
Fixed: "Return to Gui" usin Mplayer Gui and starting a video leads to crash (MP_CMD_QUIT: mplayer\mplayer.c, command.c)
Fixed: .avi files not playing after a .mkv, .mov or .mp4 files has been played (mplayer.conf) 
Added: "Restart" and "Shutdown" buttons (source\menu.cpp) 
Added: "Subtitle Size" under Settings - Atm you can only change size before starting you first video, after that you need to restart to take effect (source\menu.cpp, mplayer_cfg.h, preferences.cpp)
Vsync is now enabled by default (disable via Gui) 
------------------------
V2:
Added: Smart Menu, it now remembers your last selection when exiting, or playing a video (source\menu.cpp, source\libwiigui\gui_filebrowser.cpp)
